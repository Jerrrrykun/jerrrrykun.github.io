I am currently a first-year CS Ph.D. student at [School of Computing and Augmented Intelligence (SCAI), ASU](https://scai.engineering.asu.edu/), fortunately advised by Prof. [Ben Zhou](http://xuanyu.me/) @ [*AI Reasoning & Cognition (ARC) Lab*](https://arc-asu.github.io/). My research focuses on natural language processing and language models. Specifically, I am passionate about **pushing the boundaries of reasoning abilities in LLM and LLM-based applications**, which is fundamental in incorporating AI to tackle real-world challenges with humans.

**I will join the AMD GenAI Team as a research intern for 2025 Summer!ðŸ¤—**

Previously, I did a research internship at Stanford SALT lab with Prof. [Diyi Yang](https://cs.stanford.edu/~diyiy/index.html). During my master's study, my research journey was significantly enriched by research internships at [AWS Shanghai AI Lab](https://www.amazonaws.cn/en/ailab/) and [Tongyi Qwen Lab, Alibaba Group](https://tongyi.aliyun.com/), where I received great support and mentorships from [Xiangkun Hu](https://www.amazon.science/author/xiangkun-hu), [Ruixue Ding](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wAktw3cAAAAJ&hl), Prof. [Yue Zhang](https://frcchang.github.io/), Prof. [Zheng Zhang](https://twitter.com/zz_aws_nyush). I earned my **bachelor's and master's degrees in applied mathematics** at [School of Mathematical Science, Fudan University](https://math.fudan.edu.cn/mathen/main.htm) in 2021 and 2024, respectively.
